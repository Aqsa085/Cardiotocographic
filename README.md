Objective:
The main goal of this assignment is to conduct a thorough exploratory analysis of the "cardiographic.csv" dataset to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the dataset's underlying structure. You will use statistical summaries, visualizations, and data manipulation techniques to explore the dataset comprehensively.
Dataset:
1.	LB - Likely stands for "Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)" which represents the average fetal heart rate over a period.
2.	AC - Could represent "Accelerations" in the FHR. Accelerations are usually a sign of fetal well-being.
3.	FM - May indicate "Fetal Movements" detected by the monitor.
4.	UC - Likely denotes "Uterine Contractions", which can impact the FHR pattern.
5.	DL - Could stand for "Decelerations Late" with respect to uterine contractions, which can be a sign of fetal distress.
6.	DS - May represent "Decelerations Short" or decelerations of brief duration.
7.	DP - Could indicate "Decelerations Prolonged", or long-lasting decelerations.
8.	ASTV - Might refer to "Percentage of Time with Abnormal Short Term Variability" in the FHR.
9.	MSTV - Likely stands for "Mean Value of Short Term Variability" in the FHR.
10.	ALTV - Could represent "Percentage of Time with Abnormal Long Term Variability" in the FHR.
11.	MLTV - Might indicate "Mean Value of Long Term Variability" in the FHR.
